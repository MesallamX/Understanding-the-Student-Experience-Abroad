*A Journey Through Data: Understanding the Student Experience Abroad*

Excited to share a project that's close to my heart. I've always been curious about how studying abroad shapes us, not just academically, but emotionally and mentally. So, I dived into the data to uncover some truths.

1️⃣ **The Starting Point**: Began by categorizing student data. It's fascinating to see the diverse paths students take.
2️⃣ **A Closer Look**: Then, I compared the experiences of different student types. Each story behind the data is unique.
3️⃣ **Numbers Tell a Story**: Analyzed diagnostic tests to understand the broader trends in student mental health. It’s more than just numbers; it’s about well-being.
4️⃣ **Focus on International Students**: Here, the data became personal. It reflected the journey of many friends and peers who've studied abroad.
5️⃣ **The Impact of Time**: My final discovery was about how the duration of stay abroad affects mental health. A longer stay seems to ease the stress of adapting to new cultures.

🔍 *Personal Insight*: The data spoke volumes. It showed that time heals and adapts, even in new environments. 

📈 Here's a glimpse of what I found:
| Stay (Years) | Avg PHQ | Avg SCS | Avg AS |
|--------------|---------|---------|--------|
| 10           | 13.0    | 32.0    | 50.00  |
| ...          | ...     | ...     | ...    |
*(More details in the full report)*

This project was more than an analysis. It was a journey through the lives of students across the globe, understanding their challenges and resilience. It’s a reminder of the power of time and adaptation.

Let's use this data to build a more supportive environment for our international scholars. 🎓
