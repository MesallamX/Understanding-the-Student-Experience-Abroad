**A Journey Through Data: Understanding the Student Experience Abroad**

Excited to share a project that's close to my heart. I've always been curious about how studying abroad shapes us, not just academically, but emotionally and mentally. So, I dived into the data to uncover some truths.

1Ô∏è‚É£ **The Starting Point**: Began by categorizing student data. It's fascinating to see the diverse paths students take.
2Ô∏è‚É£ **A Closer Look**: Then, I compared the experiences of different student types. Each story behind the data is unique.
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Numbers Tell a Story**: Analyzed diagnostic tests to understand the broader trends in student mental health. It‚Äôs more than just numbers; it‚Äôs about well-being.
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Focus on International Students**: Here, the data became personal. It reflected the journey of many friends and peers who've studied abroad.
5Ô∏è‚É£ **The Impact of Time**: My final discovery was about how the duration of stay abroad affects mental health. A longer stay seems to ease the stress of adapting to new cultures.

üîç *Personal Insight*: The data spoke volumes. It showed that time heals and adapts, even in new environments. 

üìà Here's a glimpse of what I found:

| Stay (Years) | Average PHQ Score | Average SCS Score | Average AS Score |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 10           | 13.00             | 32.00             | 50.00            |
| 8            | 10.00             | 44.00             | 65.00            |
| 7            | 4.00              | 48.00             | 45.00            |
| 6            | 6.00              | 38.00             | 58.67            |
| 5            | 0.00              | 34.00             | 91.00            |
| 4            | 8.57              | 33.93             | 87.71            |
| 3            | 9.09              | 37.13             | 78.00            |
| 2            | 8.28              | 37.08             | 77.67            |
| 1            | 7.48              | 38.11             | 72.80            |

This table comprehensively displays the average scores in PHQ (Patient Health Questionnaire), SCS (Self-Compassion Scale), and AS (Acculturative Stress) against the length of stay (in years) for international students.

**This project was more than an analysis. It was a journey through the lives of students across the globe, understanding their challenges and resilience. It‚Äôs a reminder of the power of time and adaptation.**

Let's use this data to build a more supportive environment for our international scholars. üéì
